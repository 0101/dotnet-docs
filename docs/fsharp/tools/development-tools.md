# F# Development Tools

This article describes some of the primary development tools used with F#.

## .NET Command-line Tools

You can install command-line tools for F# in multiple ways, depending on your environment. See [Install F#](../get-started/install-fsharp.md).

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

### F# with Visual Studio

F# can be installed as part of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). See [Getting Stared with F# in Visual Studio](../get-started/get-started-visual-studio.md).

### F# with Visual Studio Code

F# can be installed as part of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com//). See [Getting Stared with F# in Visual Studio Code](../get-started/get-started-vscode.md).

### F# with Visual Studio for Mac

F# can be installed as part of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com//). See [Getting Stared with F# in Visual Studio Code](../get-started/get-started-vscode.md).

### Other development environments

Other IDEs are available for F#, see [F# Tools](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/languages/fsharp/tools)

## F# for JavaScript

F# can execute as JavaScript code through two community-provided open source toolchains:

* [Fable](https://fable.io/) is a compiler that brings F# into the JavaScript ecosystem. It generates modern JavaScript output, interoperates with JavaScript packages and supports multiple development models including React.
* [WebSharper](https://github.com/dotnet-websharper/core) - Provides full-stack, functional reactive web programming for .NET, allowing you to develop microservices, client-server web applications, reactive SPAs, and more in C# or F#.

## F# Notebooks

[.NET Interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/#net-interactive-) F# notebooks can be used with [Jupyter](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/#jupyter-and-nteract), [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive#notebooks-with-net) and [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MLNET.notebook).

## F# for ML.NET

[ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) is an open source and cross-platform machine learning framework built for .NET developers.

With ML.NET, you can create custom ML models using C# or F# without having to leave the .NET ecosystem. ML.NET lets you re-use all the knowledge, skills, code, and libraries you already have as a .NET developer so that you can easily integrate machine learning into your web, mobile, desktop, games, and IoT apps.

## F# for Full Stack Web Development

[SAFE Stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/) is a community-driven technology stack for functional-first web applications. SAFE Stack allows you to quickly develop compelling web applications that use industry-standard technologies whilst using F# to ensure an enjoyable development experience.

## Community Tools

Many tools and libraries for F# are provided by the F# community. These include:

* [**Fantomas**](https://github.com/fsprojects/fantomas#fantomas) - The F# code formatting tool
* [**FSharpLint**](https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharpLint/) - The F# code checking tool
* [**FAKE**](https://fsprojects.github.io/FAKE/) - An F# build automation tool
