# F# for Server-Side Web Development

F# excels at building efficient, scalable and robust web solutions. Web programming is based around receiving a single HTTP request and replying with a result, which maps very well to a stateless, functional approach. This article gives links to some significant resources related to this mode of use of F#.

## Giraffe

[Giraffe](https://safe-stack.github.io/) is a community-driven F# library for building rich web applications with superb performance. It has been specifically designed with ASP.NET Core in mind and can be added into ASP.NET Core pipelines.

## Saturn

[Saturn](https://saturnframework.org/) is a community-driven F# web development framework which implements the server-side MVC pattern. Many of its components and concepts will seem familiar to anyone with experience in other web frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Python’s Django. It’s built on top of Giraffe and ASP.NET Core - modern, cross-platform, high-performance development platform for building cloud-ready web applications.

Other web server development options are documented in the F# Software Foundation's [Guide to Web Programming with F#](https://fsharp.org/guides/web).
