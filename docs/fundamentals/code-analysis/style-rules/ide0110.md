# Discard can be removed (IDE0110)

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** | IDE0080 |
| **Title** | Discard can be removed |
| **Category** | Style |
| **Subcategory** | Unnecessary code rules |
| **Applicable languages** | C# |

## Overview

This rule flags unnecessary [discard patterns](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/csharp-8.0/patterns.md#discard-pattern), when this discard pattern is used in a context where it has no effect. 

This rule has no associated code style option.

## Example

```csharp
// Code with violations
switch (o)
{
    case int _:
        Console.WriteLine("Value was an int");
        break;
    case string _:
        Console.WriteLine("Value was a string");
        break;
}

// Fixed code
switch (o)
{
    case int:
        Console.WriteLine("Value was an int");
        break;
    case string:
        Console.WriteLine("Value was a string");
        break;
}
```
